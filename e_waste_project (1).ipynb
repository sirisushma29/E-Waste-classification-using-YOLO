The goal is to leverage the pre-trained features of EfficientNetB3, fine-tune its custom head for the specific classification problem, and train a model capable of accurately classifying images into two classes (binary classification). The implementation includes data augmentation during training, learning rate scheduling, and the evaluation of key metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score) to assess the model's performance on unseen test data. The final trained model is saved for potential future use or deployment."
